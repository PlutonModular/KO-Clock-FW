# KO Clock Official FW
Official firmware for Pluton modular KO Clock.

Uses PlatformIO in VS Code :heart:

## Information
KO Clock is an upcoming clock source/subdivision module in Eurorack format, available soon enough. I'm making this an open source firmware in the hopes that any shortcomings can be located and fixed by people with more experience and talent than me. :smile:
